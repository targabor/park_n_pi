## 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an autonomous car powered by a Raspberry Pi that can recognize parking spaces 🅿️ using image processing (e.g., YOLO) and perform forward parking maneuvers 🚙 using reinforcement learning (RL). The goal is to enable the car to identify available spaces and park itself in various scenarios with precision.
