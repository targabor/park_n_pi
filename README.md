> MSc Thesis Project - University of Pannonia

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a reinforcement learning (RL)-based goal navigation system for an autonomous car platform using a Raspberry Pi 5 and the Raspbot V2 chassis.  
The core objective is to enable the robot to reach designated goal poses efficiently and reliably using deep reinforcement learning techniques, serving as a foundation for future autonomous parking maneuvers.

All experiments and evaluations presented in this project were conducted within a high-fidelity Webots simulation environment, integrated with ROS 2 Jazzy and Gymnasium.

Real-world deployment onto the Raspberry Pi 5 is planned for future extensions.

## Features

- PPO-based reinforcement learning policy (Stable-Baselines3)
- ROS 2 Jazzy full simulation integration
- Custom vectorized Webots environments for faster training
- Curriculum learning for progressive goal-reaching difficulty
- Dockerized setup for easy reproducibility
- TensorBoard support for training monitoring
- Modular architecture supporting future real-world deployment

## Getting Started

First, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t park_n_pi_docker .
```

Then start the container using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d
```

Enter the container:

```bash
docker exec -it park_n_pi_dev bash
```

Inside the container, launch the Webots simulation and ROS2 nodes:

```bash
ros2 launch raspbotv2_bringup rl_training.launch.py num_robots:=8
```

Open a new terminal and connect again to the container:

```bash
docker exec -it park_n_pi_dev bash
cd src/park_n_pi/ros_park_n_pi/src/raspbot_rl_env/scripts/
python3 run_wo_vecenv.py --num_envs 8 --total_timesteps 1_500_000 --tb_log_name RunName
```

This starts the reinforcement learning training loop!
## Usage

- Simulation and ROS2 nodes start automatically.

- Training runs with Stable-Baselines3 agents.

- Logs and models are saved under /home/dev_ws/src/park_n_pi/logs/

Stopping everything:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Rebuilding if needed:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```
